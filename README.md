# ems-htuwar
A CRM system which uses Node and Express as a backend. It uses Mongo DB to store user's data such as name, email and 
password(in encrypted type). It uses PostgreSQL to store the department and employee data such as name, number, full time or 
part time and many more. 
Front end is developed with the help of JS, HTML, CSS, jQuery and Bootstrap.

For password protection and encryption, bcrypt is used. This app is also using the session and storing the cookies in the user's
computer. I am also storing the cookies data into the postgreSQL.

The live and working verion of this app can be found on the below link.
